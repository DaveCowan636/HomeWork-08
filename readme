I had a very hard time with this weeks homework.
I understood the concept of having a separate style page with
CSS, but had a hard time connecting with the layout portion of CSS.
After A lot of trial and error I was able to come close with it, I
still wasn't completely happy with my layout but will have to come back
to it.
The Color palate I chose was a neutral background color and decided to
use a blue for male and a red for female to help distinguish between
who was talking during the story. I thought the fonts I used made
the story easily readable, giving it more of a story vibe.
